# Themeable-Clock
This is a digital clock. 
It has 5 different themes that you can choose from.
The default theme is the Light theme.
When you choose a theme it gets saved in the browsers Local storage and when the browser is refreshed the theme stays the same.
It also says a little greeting to me ðŸ˜… - Ebuka. You could say that's my little touch.

It was a fun project. It helped me practice all that I have learnt so far in JavaScript.
